/**
 * What the containers on the machine are doing.
 *
 * <p><b>The backend never touches the Docker socket.</b> Handing
 * {@code /var/run/docker.sock} to a web application is handing it root on the
 * host — anything that can talk to that socket can start a privileged container
 * and own the machine. One remote-code-execution bug in here would go from
 * "reads some metrics" to "owns the server" with no further steps.
 *
 * <p>So a separate container holds the socket and republishes a filtered,
 * GET-only slice of the Docker API on the internal compose network. This class
 * speaks plain HTTP to that. The proxy answers {@code 403} to every write —
 * restart, exec, image pull — which was verified against the running VPS rather
 * than assumed. Nothing is published to the host, so the only thing that can
 * reach it is a container on the same network.
 *
 * <p>Unreachable is a normal state, not an error: local development usually has
 * no proxy running. Every path below returns "unavailable, and here is why"
 * rather than throwing, and the screen says so instead of showing zeros.
